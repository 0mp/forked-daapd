Installation instructions for forked-daapd
------------------------------------------

Required tools:
 - ANTLR v3 is required to build forked-daapd, along with its C runtime
   (libantlr3c). Use at least version 3.1.x of ANTLR v3 and the matching
   C runtime version.

The configure script will look for a wrapper called antlr3 in the PATH to
invoke ANTLR. If it doesn't exist, it'll try to invoke ANTLR directly with
'java org.antlr.Tool'; make sure your CLASSPATH is set properly, and if it
doesn't work, just create the wrapper somewhere in your PATH.

Libraries:
 - glibc 2.9+ (for signalfd)
 - Avahi client libraries, 0.6.24 minimum
 - sqlite3
 - ffmpeg
 - confuse
 - libevent 1.4+
 - libavl
 - MiniXML
 - libflac (optional)
 - taglib (optional)

libavl is not the GNU libavl. There doesn't seem to be an upstream website
anymore, but you can fetch it from any Debian mirror for instance (it'll be
in /debian/pool/main/liba/libavl).

FLAC and Musepack support are optional. If not enabled, metadata extraction
will fail on these files.

Recommended build settings:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --enable-flac --enable-musepack

After installation, edit the configuration file, /etc/forked-daapd.conf and
adjust the values at your convenience.

forked-daapd will drop privileges to any user you'll specify in the
configuration file if it's started as root. It's recommended to create a
dedicated user without login privileges. That user must have read permissions
on your library.

You'll need an init script if you want to start forked-daapd at boot. A simple
init script will do, forked-daapd daemonizes all by itself and creates a
pidfile under /var/run.
